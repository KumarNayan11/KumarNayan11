# Hi, I’m Nayan Jain

**IT Student | Cybersecurity & Full Stack Development**

I am an Information Technology student with a strong interest in building secure, scalable web applications and understanding how systems can be protected against real-world threats. My work focuses on combining **full stack development** with **cybersecurity fundamentals** to create projects that are both functional and resilient.

I enjoy working on practical, impact-driven projects, learning modern development practices, and continuously improving my skills in networking, application security, and backend systems.
